# Django Box 📦 - in development
*A small-scale, hobbiest-driven django application that manages makerspace inventory*

![tests](https://github.com/EDED2314/djangobox/actions/workflows/django.yml/badge.svg)

## Features 🚀
1. Inventory management: So far, this is through the admin panel, a UI will be coming shortly

2. Modular storage: In many github repos that offer templates in inventory management, they do not address the variability in the storage structure that can exist in a makerspace. What DjangoBox does is creating a tree out of every storage unit and item so that a modular design is achieved.

3. Easy set up + Any platform: With the help of python, platform support is extremely easy

## Setup👀
